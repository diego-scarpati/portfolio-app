        Former senior accountant at EY who always was intrigued by programming.
        For me, the Covid lockdown was the kickstarter in the wonderful of
        development, beginning with Python and turning my way into JavaScript.
        Over the last year I’ve been working as a R&D Analyst in Argentina
        developing a mobile app regarding Health and Digital Identity.

        Working as a developer I tend to feel like a kid who’s playing a logic
        game, smiling and celebrating whenever I either create a new component,
        feature or program. Focused on UX/UI without forgetting what the product
        aims to solve.

        What you’ll get is a dev that loves to work in a diverse team, but can
        also do solo tasks. A former captain of a soccer team with friends on
        weekends, tennis player during weekdays, but also someone who will
        transmit positive energy and a smile everyday.
